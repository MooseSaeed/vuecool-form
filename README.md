## Reactive Form with Dynamic Fields

### Initialize Reactive Variables:

Inside the setup option, you'll need to create reactive variables to hold the form data for each input. Here's an example of how to start:

```javascript
const name = ... // For the "Name" input
const formValidation = ... // For fields validation
```

### Check Your Logic with Vue DevTools:

Before proceeding further, it's a good practice to use Vue DevTools to ensure that your logic is functioning as expected.

### Transition to script setup:

Next, you should move your code from the script option to the script setup.

### Double-Check Your Logic:

Once you've moved your code to script setup, make sure to use Vue DevTools again to ensure that your logic still works as intended.

### Manage Checkbox State:

Within the script setup, implement the logic to handle and maintain the state of the checkbox input.
